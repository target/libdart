## Dart Parsing/Writing Performance
**TL;DR**:

**Dart** makes some parsing performance concessions to meet other design goals,
but the performance is still [quite good](#results).

**Long Version**:

As a library, **Dart**'s primary design goals are:
  1. Be the fastest way to represent `JSON` on the wire, requiring
     as little receiver-side effort as possible.
  2. Be easy to use (provide a consistent, natural, API).
  3. Be the fastest general purpose `JSON` parser.

In order to meet goal one, **Dart** requires that object keys be
_lexicographically sorted_ (no other library mentioned in this document depends on,
or preserves, this property) so that they can be efficiently queried when stored in a
flat (on-the-wire) representation.

In order to meet goal two, **Dart** preserves this ordering even in _dynamic_ mode,
where it's not strictly necessary, so that object iteration order _remains stable_
regardless of whether the object is _finalized_ or not.

Many other high performance `JSON` parsing libraries exist, but very few (if any) require
this property, which **does** have performance implications.

**Dart** does not support incremental parsing, must pass through an explicit sorting
step during _finalized_ parsing, and performs sorted insertion for _non-finalized_ objects.

Despite these restrictions, **Dart**'s parsing performance is quite good, running within
about 50% of [RapidJSON](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson), and will likely still
exceed that of `[insert library name here]`.

## Building Dart Head-to-Head Parsing/Writing Tests
**Dart** comes included with a parsing benchmark driver that depends on
[Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark), which must be installed prior
to attempting to build the benchmark driver.
Assuming GBench has been installed:
```bash
# Clone it down.
git clone git@github.com:target/libdart.git
cd libdart/

# Create the cmake build directory and prepare a build
# of the benchmark driver without tests.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -Dtest=OFF -Dbenchmark=ON

# Build the benchmark driver.
make

# Run the benchmark driver.
benchmark/configurable_bench
```
On my middle-end 2018 MacBook Pro, this outputs something like the following:

```
The output from the previous command is generated by running each test case a
single time, which can produce somewhat noisy results, especially for the fastest
test cases.

Averaging this out across many independent runs gives more stable results, and
can be performed with the following command:
```
benchmark/configurable_bench --benchmark_repetitions={number of repetitions} --benchmark_report_aggregates_only=true
```

## Results
Using the file found at `benchmark/input.json` (which can be replaced with any
newline-separated json file to test your own data), averaged across 16 repetitions,
this produces the following results:

An initial takeaway from this is that [Chad Austin](https://github.com/chadaustin)
is a crazy wizard man who deserves another
[shoutout](https://chadaustin.me/2017/05/writing-a-really-really-fast-json-parser/).
If raw parsing performance, above anything else, is what you're looking for,
[sajson](https://github.com/chadaustin/sajson) will get you there.

If, however, you're looking for something a bit safer/easier to use, you need to
work with large objects, or you need network integration, **Dart** can provide all
of this, while also providing best, or second-best, performance for all JSON needs.
