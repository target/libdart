## Dart Performance

**TL;DR**:
Dart's performance is [excellent](#results).

**Long Version**:

As a library, **Dart** tries to walk a fine line between providing the
highest possible performance, while also enabling expressive usability
across a wide variety of domains.

As mentioned in the [readme](README.md#explicit-api-lifecycle), **Dart**
publicly exposes several different classes for interacting with its API
at various levels of abstraction and peformance: `dart::packet`,
`dart::heap`, and `dart::buffer`.

Additionally, as mentioned in the [expert usage](ADVANCED.md) document,
**Dart** exposes a variety of customization points to modify the reference
counter implementation used by the library.

## Performance Characteristics of Dart Types
`dart::packet` is the most flexible of the aforementioned classes, erasing
implementation details related to type, mutability, and layout, and
providing a uniform, and reasonably performant, API for all use-cases.
For the basic case of using **Dart** as a dead-simple `JSON`/`YAML`
parser, this is likely to be the class you want.
This flexibility is not without cost, however, and `dart::packet` should
typically be assumed to be the slowest of the types exported by the
**Dart** library.

`dart::heap` is used to represent a dynamic tree of objects, trading
performance for mutability, and is intended for use-cases where mutation
is mandatory and common. It implements a nearly identical API compared
with `dart::packet`, but will be marginally faster in all cases where
`dart::packet::is_finalized` returns false.

`dart::buffer` is the highest performance class exposed by the library,
and is used to enable read-only interaction with an arbitrary object tree
with the least overhead possible. Exposing a subset of the `dart::packet`
API, a `dart::buffer` instance is guaranteed to _**never**_ allocate
memory in any member function (with the exception of functions that return
STL containers and conversion operators to other **Dart** types), and
is guaranteed to be stored contiguously as a flattened buffer of bytes
(accessible via `dart::buffer::get_bytes` or `dart::buffer::dup_bytes`)
immediately ready for distribution over a socket/file/shared memory queue/etc.

## Measuring Dart Performance
Given the API topology mentioned above, all performance validation cases
for **Dart** first consider whether the operation being tested requires
mutation (in which case `dart::heap` is used) or not (in which case
`dart::buffer` is used).

Additionally, all **Dart** performance test cases override the default
reference counter implementation, replacing it with `dart::unsafe_ptr`,
which implements thread-_unsafe_ reference counting.

## Building Dart Performance Tests
The included benchmark driver depends on
[Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark), which must be
installed prior to attempting to build the benchmark driver.
Assuming GBench has been installed:
```bash
# Clone it down.
git clone git@github.com:target/libdart.git
cd libdart/

# Create the cmake build directory and prepare a build
# of the benchmark driver without tests.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -Dtest=OFF -Dbenchmark=ON

# Build the benchmark driver.
make

# Run the benchmark driver.
benchmark/static_bench
```
On my middle-end 2018 MacBook Pro, this outputs something like the following:
```

```
The output from the previous command is generated by running each test case a
single time, which can produce somewhat noisy results, especially for the fastest
test cases.

Averaging this out across many independent runs gives more stable results, and
can be performed with the following command:
```
benchmark/static_bench --benchmark_repetitions={number of repetitions} --benchmark_report_aggregates_only=true
```

This will produce output for the mean test case performance, along with its
standard deviation, which is what was used to produce the graph on the main page
(16 repetitions in that particular case).

## Head-to-Head Performance Comparisons
The graph on the main page plots **Dart** performance
vs [sajson](https://github.com/chadaustin/sajson)
vs [Google Flexbuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)
and if those libraries are installed when building the benchmark driver, it will
automatically output an apples-to-apples comparison of similar operations with
those libraries.

## Understanding Benchmark Output
As you can see, **Dart** measures performance across a wide-variety of categories,
descriptions of those categories are listed below.

### Parse Flat/Nested Dynamic Packet
These benchmark cases are testing the whole stack of dynamic **Dart** `JSON` parsing,
from a `std::string`, parsed by the **RapidJSON** SAX parser, raised into a dynamic
`dart::heap` representation.

The distinction between the **nested** and **flat** test cases are precisely what
their names would suggest: the **flat** test case exists all at one level, whereas
the **nested** test benchmarks the additional overhead from creating nested objects.

### Parse Flat/Nested Finalized Packet
These benchmark cases are testing the whole stack of finalized **Dart** `JSON` parsing,
from a `std::string`, parsed by the **RapidJSON** DOM parser, lowered into a finalized,
contiguous, `dart::buffer` representation.

### Lookup Finalized Random Fields
This is a family of benchmark cases that test the performance of key-lookups on
a finalized packet (using `dart::buffer`).

The test cases are generated from the following parameter matrix:

| Number of Keys in Packet | Number of Characters per Key |
|:------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
|             1            |               4              |
|             8            |               4              |
|            64            |               4              |
|           256            |               4              |
|             1            |               8              |
|             8            |               8              |
|            64            |               8              |
|           256            |               8              |
|             1            |              64              |
|             8            |              64              |
|            64            |              64              |
|           256            |              64              |
|             1            |             256              |
|             8            |             256              |
|            64            |             256              |
|           256            |             256              |

This is considered to be the most important test-case from a performance perspective,
and is performed by generating a random set of keys of the specified size and length,
generating a finalized **Dart** object that contains all of those keys, and then
iterating over the set of keys and looking them up in the packet that was just
generated.

Each separate _repetition_ of each test case performed operates on an
_independently generated_ set of random keys.

### Lookup Finalized Colliding Fields
This is a family of benchmark cases that test the performance of key-lookups when
the keyspace of the packet being tested is intentionally filled with prefix collisions
(uses `dart::buffer`).

The test cases are generated from the following parameter matrix:

| Percentage of Collisions in Packet | Number of Keys in Packet | Number of Characters per Key |
|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
|                 0                  |            16            |               8              |
|                 8                  |            16            |               8              |
|                32                  |            16            |               8              |
|                64                  |            16            |               8              |
|               100                  |            16            |               8              |
|                 0                  |            64            |               8              |
|                 8                  |            64            |               8              |
|                32                  |            64            |               8              |
|                64                  |            64            |               8              |
|               100                  |            64            |               8              |
|                 0                  |           256            |               8              |
|                 8                  |           256            |               8              |
|                32                  |           256            |               8              |
|                64                  |           256            |               8              |
|               100                  |           256            |               8              |

This is considered to be the second most important test-case from a performance perspective,
and serves to validate the real-world applicability of **Dart**'s prefix optimizations.

It is performed by first generating a random set of keys that _do not_ have any collisions
in their prefix bytes (best case scenario for **Dart**), and then intentionally inserting
additional, randomly colliding, keys until the requested collision percentage is reached
(will always generate _at least_ the percentage requested, may actually generate a higher
percentage depending on the total number of keys requested).

Each separate _repetition_ of each test case performed operates on an
_independently generated_ set of randomly colliding keys.

### Lookup Dynamic Random Fields
This is a family of benchmark cases that test the performance of key-lookups on
a dynamic packet (using `dart::heap`).

This benchmark case is identical to the previous benchmark from a methodological
perspective, the crucial difference being that this test measures the performance
of dynamic key lookups instead of finalized key lookups.

### Iterate over Random, Finalized, Fields
This is a family of benchmark cases that test the peformance of finalized object
iteration, iterating over a set of randomly generated strings.

The test cases are generated from the following parameter matrix:

| Number of Fields in Packet |
|:--------------------------:|
|             1              |
|             8              |
|            64              |
|           256              |

Each separate _repetition_ of each test case performed operates on an
_independently generated_ set of random fields.

### Iterate over Random, Dynamic, Fields
This is a family of benchmark cases that test the peformance of dynamic object
iteration, iterating over a set of randomly generated strings.

The test cases are generated from the following parameter matrix:

| Number of Fields in Packet |
|:--------------------------:|
|             1              |
|             8              |
|            64              |
|           256              |

Each separate _repetition_ of each test case performed operates on an
_independently generated_ set of random fields.

### Sequentially Access Finalized Strings
This benchmark case measures the performance of sequentially pulling strings
out of a finalized array (`dart::buffer`).

This benchmark is intended to benchmark the performance of array lookup, and
simply iterates from 0 -> [array size] and loads a value for each index.

and generates a set of random indices and loads a value for each index.

### Insertions into an Exclusive Dynamic Object
This benchmark case measures the cost of inserting a new key-value pair into a
dynamic object (`dart::heap`) _that is not shared_.

**Dart** uses a copy-on-write strategy to allow frictionless mutation of shared
data in a multi-threaded environment, and so the relative cost of inserting
something into a packet changes if the associated packet state is shared across
multiple instances.

### Insertions into an Exclusive Dynamic Array
This benchmark case measures the cost of pushing a new element onto the end of a
dynamic array (`dart::heap`) _that is not shared_.

This benchmark case measures the cost of inserting a new key-value pair into a
dynamic object (`dart::heap`) _that is shared_.

This benchmark case is identical to the previous benchmark from a methodological
perspective, the crucial difference being that this test measures the performance
of dynamic key-value pair insertions into an object that shares its representation
across multiple packet instances, and therefore must perform a shallow copy-out
before performing the insertion.

### Finalize a Dynamic Packet
This benchmark case measures the cost of *finalizing* a dynamic packet
(the cost of casting a `dart::heap` into a `dart::buffer`).

This operation consists of recursively climbing through the dynamic representation
once to calculate an upper bound on the required size of the contiguous buffer,
performing a single allocation of the calculated size, and then recursively walking
across the dynamic representation a second time and lowering it into the allocated buffer.

### Serialize Flat/Nested Finalized Packet
These benchmark cases are testing the whole stack of **Dart** `JSON` generation,
from a finalized representation (`dart::buffer`), fed into a **RapidJSON** writer,
and output as a `std::string`.

The distinction between the **nested** and **flat** test cases are precisely what
their names would suggest: the **flat** test case exists all at one level, whereas
the **nested** test benchmarks the additional overhead of nested objects.
